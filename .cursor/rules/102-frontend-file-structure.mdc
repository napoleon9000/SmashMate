# File Structure Guidelines

All frontend code lives under the `frontend/` directory at the repository root.

```
frontend/
├── App.tsx              # Expo entry point
├── app.config.ts        # Expo configuration
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── screens/             # Screen components for navigation
├── navigation/          # React Navigation setup
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                 # API clients and shared utilities
├── assets/              # Images, fonts, and static assets
├── theme/               # Light/Dark theme definitions
├── tests/               # Jest test files
└── package.json         # Node dependencies
```

Place each screen in its own subfolder inside `screens/` with an `index.tsx` file and related styles. Components that are used across multiple screens go in `components/`.

Keep API interaction functions in `lib/api.ts` and data-fetching hooks in `hooks/use*.ts`.
